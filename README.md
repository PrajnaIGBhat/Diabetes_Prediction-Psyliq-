**Diabetes Prediction**
This project aims to predict diabetes by analyzing patient data using SQL queries. The dataset includes demographic, clinical, and lifestyle information. By extracting relevant insights, this project helps identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes, which can support healthcare providers in taking timely preventive actions.

**Objectives**
1.Analyze patient data through SQL queries. 2.Extract key insights such as BMI, blood glucose levels, and hypertension. 3.Optimize the database schema and SQL query performance.

**Data Description**
The dataset used in this project consists of 100,000 patient records and includes 11 key attributes. Below is a description of each attribute:
Patient ID: A unique identifier for each patient.
Date of Birth: The birthdate of the patient, used to calculate age.
Gender: The gender of the patient (e.g., Male, Female).
BMI (Body Mass Index): A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
Blood Glucose Levels: Blood sugar levels, crucial for detecting diabetes.
Hypertension (Blood Pressure): Indicates if the patient has high blood pressure.
Smoking History: Patient's history with smoking (e.g., Current smoker, Ex-smoker, Non-smoker).
Heart Disease: Indicates whether the patient has been diagnosed with heart disease.
HbA1c Levels: Glycated hemoglobin level, used as an indicator for blood sugar control over the past few months.
Diabetes: A binary indicator (Yes/No) of whether the patient has diabetes.
Lifestyle Information: Additional lifestyle factors that might affect the patientâ€™s health (e.g., physical activity, diet).
Data Format: Number of Records: 100,000 patients. Attributes:11 columns. Types of Data: A combination of numerical data (e.g., BMI, Glucose Levels) and categorical data (e.g., Gender, Smoking History).
